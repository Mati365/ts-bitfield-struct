Small typescript utility class that helps with creating bit fields and C unions

## Usage

```typescript
import UnionStruct from 'ts-union-struct';

class Register extends UnionStruct {
  @UnionStruct.bits(0) lsb: number;
  @UnionStruct.bits(15) msb: number;

  @UnionStruct.bits(0, 7) low: number;
  @UnionStruct.bits(8, 15) high: number;
}

// later in code..
const reg = new Register(0xFF_EE);

console.log(reg.number); // => 0xFF_EE
reg.low = 0x0;
console.log(reg.number); // => 0xFF_00

```
